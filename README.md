#Resume on npm

This project allows you to view my resume directly in your terminal using `npx`. It is published as a public npm package for quick access and demonstration.

---

## Usage

To view my resume in the terminal, simply run:

```bash
npx ranjith-kumar-p
```

> Make sure you have **Node.js** and **npm** installed on your system.

## Setup & Installation (for local development)

If you want to run or modify this project locally, follow these steps:

2. Open a terminal in the project directory.
3. Install the required dependencies:

This will display your resume in the terminal and open the PDF file (if coded to do so).

## About This Package

This npm package displays my resume in a well-formatted, terminal-friendly format using `chalk` for color styling. It also uses the `open` package to allow users to optionally open a PDF version of the resume in their default system browser or PDF viewer.

## Naming Issue (npm Package Name)

Originally, the package name was intended to be:

```
ranjith-kumar-p-102018287
```

However, npm flagged this as potential **spam or suspicious**, likely due to the numerical ID (`102018287`) at the end. To resolve this, the package was renamed to:

```
ranjith-kumar-p
```

> Tip: Avoid using long numerical IDs or overly complex names in public npm packages, especially if they resemble autogenerated usernames or spam patterns.
